## Installation
  To install simply download the repository, run 'npm init' in the terminal, and run 'npm install Inquirer' in the terminal.
## Usage
  Once node index.js is entered into the terminal the user will be prompted with a series of questions. The answers to these questions will dynamically create a README with a table of contents and sections reflecting the user inputs. Once all prompts have been answered the README.md file will be generated for the user.
